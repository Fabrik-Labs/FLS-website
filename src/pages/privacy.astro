        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Fabrik Labs ("we," "us," or "our") operates the website at www.fabriklabs.co. This policy explains what information we collect when you visit our site and how we use it.</p>

        <h2>What We Collect</h2>
        <p>We do not collect personal information such as your name, email address, or phone number through this website. We do not use contact forms, newsletter signups, or account registration.</p>
        <p>We use Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager to collect anonymous usage data about how visitors interact with our site. This includes information such as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Pages visited and time spent on each page</li>

          <li>General geographic location (city/country level, not precise location)</li>

        </ul>
        <p>This data is aggregated and anonymous — we cannot identify individual visitors from it.</p>

        <h2>Cookies</h2>
        <p>Google Analytics uses cookies to distinguish unique visitors and track sessions. These are small text files stored in your browser. You can disable cookies through your browser settings at any time, though this may affect how some websites function.</p>
