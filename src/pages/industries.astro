          We focus on nonprofits and ed-tech organizations. Like any team, they're struggling with systems that can't keep up with growth. But they also tend to have tighter budgets and fewer internal resources—which means they need partners who can stretch a dollar and make good decisions the first time.

            <p class="font-sans text-16px text-slate leading-relaxed">
              As volunteers and members of nonprofit boards ourselves, we understand the unique challenges: managing grants, coordinating volunteers, board reporting, and choosing between "good enough" tools and ones that actually fit. We build donor portals, program dashboards, volunteer systems, and internal tools that tie everything together.

            <p class="font-sans text-16px text-slate leading-relaxed">
              Ed-tech organizations have their own idiosyncrasies—student data, curriculum delivery, educator tools, compliance requirements. They're often stuck with platforms that weren't built for how learning actually works. We build student progress trackers, curriculum platforms, admin tools, and the connective tissue that makes it all work together.

            The same challenges that plague nonprofits and ed-tech—outgrown tools, disconnected systems, limited resources—hit growing SMBs too. In fact, it's where our leadership came from. While our focus is mission-driven organizations, we're happy to work with SMBs facing similar problems.
