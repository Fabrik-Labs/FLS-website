        <p class="font-sans text-18px text-charcoal-light leading-relaxed max-w-800px">
          The Alliance needed a scalable way to bring decision-making skills into classrooms—but they kept reaching for solutions before fully understanding what teachers actually needed. Without validated user insights, they risked building tools that wouldn't work in real classroom environments.

        <p class="font-sans text-14px font-semibold uppercase text-copper tracking-1.4px mb-8">The Solution</p>
        <p class="font-sans text-18px text-charcoal-light leading-relaxed max-w-800px">
          Fabrik Labs started by slowing things down. We explored multiple directions before committing to build anything. Once a clear winner emerged—an AI-powered tool that could enhance teachers' existing lesson plans—we moved into prototyping with disciplined sprints, clear timeboxes, and strong product ownership.

        <p class="font-sans text-18px text-charcoal-light leading-relaxed max-w-800px">
          The Alliance now has a working AI-driven prototype that enhances teachers' lesson plans with decision education content. More importantly, the project shifted how the organization approaches product development, proving that lean methods and user-centered thinking deliver results.
