              A few years back, I hit a wall. Big firms, massive clients, a lot of overhead—I was done. I found Fabrik Labs and discovered it was fun again to work with smaller teams on real problems.
            </p>

            <p class="font-sans text-18px text-charcoal-light leading-relaxed mb-6">
              What I like about this work is that it actually matters to the people we're helping. The organizations we serve don't have unlimited budgets or big IT departments. They need partners who can stretch a dollar and make good decisions the first time.
            </p>

            <p class="font-sans text-18px text-charcoal-light leading-relaxed mb-6">
              I believe design is more about how a thing works than how it looks. The best tools are the ones people actually use—not the ones that win awards.

              I'd love to hear what's holding you back—even if you're not sure what that is yet.
